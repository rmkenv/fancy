# Daily Number Incrementer

This repository automatically increments a number every day using GitHub Actions.

The current number is: [number from number.txt]

## How it works
- A GitHub Action runs daily at 6 AM UTC
- It reads the number from number.txt
- Increments it by 1
- Commits and pushes the change

This creates a daily commit streak on my GitHub profile!
